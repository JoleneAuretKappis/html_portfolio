<h1>The Greatest Movies According to Jolene</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Eragon</h3>
<p>Because I just love that this first book by Christopher Paolini was actually turned into a movie!</p>

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>I just love the story, animation and special effects.</p>

<h3>You've got Mail</h3>
<p>Because I am just a hopeless romantic at heart. And the combo of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks is just too cool.</p>
